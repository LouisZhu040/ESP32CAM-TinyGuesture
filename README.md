# ESP32CAM-TinyGuesture
Based on a personal experience of forgetting to enable the flashlight when taking night photos, I created an ESP32-CAM-based solution using gesture recognition. When a "Ye" gesture is detected, the flash turns on automatically. This project demonstrates how I turn small daily problems into engineering-driven solutions with TinyML.
