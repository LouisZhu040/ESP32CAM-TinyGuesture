# ESP32CAM-TinyGesture 

**ESP32-CAM Image Capture & Gesture Collection Platform**  
Captures images via a browser interface and uploads them to a Flask server‚Äîdesigned for collecting gesture data as a foundation for on-device TinyML model deployment.

---

## Why This Project Matters

Nighttime selfies are often underexposed because users forget to turn on the flash. This tool collects gesture-trigger images(‚úå) to train a TinyML model, with the goal of enabling local gesture-driven flash control‚Äîenhancing user experience with low-cost hardware.

## ‚úÖ Features

**‚úÖ Completed**
- ESP32-CAM capture photos and upload them to a browser control page
- On-click photo capture uploads JPEG via HTTP POST
- Flask server saves files

**üöß Planned**
- Image dataset collection for a specific gesture
- Train the model to detect ‚Äú‚úå‚Äù gesture
- Convert to TensorFlow Lite/TinyML
- Integrate the model on ESP32-CAM for offline gesture-controlled flash

## üöÄ How to use it

-(1) Open the PlatformIO and prepare to flash the ESP32CAM
-(2) Click the "upload" button from PlatformIO to get started
-(3) Use the following code to monitor the COM port(To be careful, # means the number of the COM port)
~~~bash
pio device monitor --port COM# --baud 115200 --rts 0 --dtr 0
~~~
-(4) Press the reset button on ESP32CAM
-(5) There is an IP for you to check the web that ESP32CAM made
-(6) Run the file named "FlaskSetup.py" to set up your Flask server
-(7) Press "Take Photo" to enable the capture function
-(8) After waiting for a while, the captured photo would be shown on your screen
-(9) The Flask will receive the data of the photo and save it into your local device
